# Spotify Data Visualization

## Overview
This project visualizes a Spotify dataset obtained from Kaggle, providing insights into various aspects of music data through engaging visualizations. The analysis is performed using Python in Jupyter Notebooks, with visualizations created using the Matplotlib and Seaborn libraries.

## Technologies Used
- **Python**
- **Jupyter Notebook**
- **Matplotlib**: For creating static, animated, and interactive visualizations.
- **Seaborn**: For making statistical graphics based on Matplotlib.

## Visualizations
The project includes the following visualizations:
- **Histogram**: To display the distribution of numerical data.
- **Scatter Plot**: To show the relationship between two continuous variables.
- **Box Plot**: To summarize the distribution of a dataset based on a five-number summary.
- **Violin Plot**: To visualize the distribution of data across different categories.
- **Pair Plot**: To visualize pairwise relationships in a dataset.
- **Count Plot**: To show the counts of observations in each categorical bin.
- **Swarm Plot**: To show the distribution of categorical data with respect to a continuous variable.
- **Point Plot**: To visualize the relationship between two variables with a point for each combination.
- **Joint Plot**: To show the relationship between two variables along with their distributions.
- **Strip Plot**: To show individual observations along with their corresponding category.
- **Facet Grid**: To visualize the distribution of data across multiple categories.
- **Hexbin Plot**: To visualize the density of data points in two dimensions.
- **Bar Plot**: To display the values of categorical data.
- **Line Plot**: To show trends over time or ordered categories.
- **3D Scatter Plot**: To visualize data in three dimensions.
